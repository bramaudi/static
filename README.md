My personal plain javascript collection that can be served as free CDN using several service to give them a proper Content-Type.

## Usage

- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bramaudi/static@main/js/maplist.js (use `.min.js`)
- https://cdn.statically.io/gh/bramaudi/static/main/js/maplist.js (use `.min.js`)
- https://gitcdn.link/cdn/bramaudi/static/main/js/maplist.js (use `min.gitcdn.link`)
- [githack](https://raw.githack.com/) then paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bramaudi/static/main/js/maplist.js`

> My favorite was jsDelivr becase it using Terser to minify
